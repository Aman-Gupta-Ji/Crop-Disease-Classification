## Abstract

This research paper presents a smart agriculture system that utilizes IoT, machine learning, image processing, cloud computing, and Android development to monitor and improve the quality of potato crops. The system captures real-time images of potato leaves using an IoT camera and Arduino module. These images are then processed using deep learning algorithms and image processing techniques to predict crop conditions. The results are communicated to farmers through an Android application, providing suggestions to prevent crop damage or loss. The system also includes a web application using React.js and FastAPI to predict plant diseases. The proposed system aims to reduce farm labor, increase efficiency, and improve the quality of crops.

## Introduction

Smart agriculture combines technology and traditional farming practices to improve production and make farming easier for farmers. This project utilizes IoT, machine learning, image processing, cloud computing, and Android development to enhance crop quality and prevent crop destruction. By collecting data on crop conditions through IoT, processing real images of crops, training a dataset using deep learning, and providing updates and suggestions through an Android application, this project aims to reduce farm labor and increase efficiency.

## Methodology

The methodology for this project involves the use of IoT, machine learning, image processing, cloud computing, and Android development. Data collection involves capturing leaf images of crops and storing them in a cloud database. Image processing techniques are applied to select a subset of images from the dataset. Deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used to process the data and make predictions on crop conditions. An API is developed to predict crop diseases based on the CNN model. Additionally, a web application using React.js is created to call the API and predict diseases. The entire implementation is focused on improving crop quality and providing suggestions for preventive measures.

## Implementation

The implementation of the smart agriculture system involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data splitting, data augmentation, feature extraction, model training, model evaluation, web application development, model deployment, and Android application development. Real images of crops were captured using cameras set up on potato plants and stored in the cloud. Image processing techniques were applied to select a subset of images from the dataset. The dataset was then used to train a CNN model for crop disease classification. A web application using React.js and FastAPI was developed to predict diseases, and an Android application was created to submit photographs and display results. The results were presented on smartphones, providing accurate predictions for crop diseases.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the smart agriculture system presented in this repository utilizes IoT, machine learning, image processing, cloud computing, and Android development to monitor and improve the quality of potato crops. The system captures real-time images, processes them using deep learning algorithms and image processing techniques, and provides accurate predictions for crop diseases. The web and Android applications enable farmers to receive suggestions for preventive measures and improve the efficiency of their farming practices. This implementation has the potential to reduce farm labor, increase crop quality, and address the challenges faced by traditional farming methods.
